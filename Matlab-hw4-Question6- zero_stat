% Write a function called zero_stat that takes a matrix as an input that only has 0 and 1 elements. 
% The function needs to compute and return the percentage of 0 elements in the matrix. 
% Do not use the if and for statement. 
% For example, if there are 10 zeros and 15 ones in a 5-by-5 matrix that is provided as an input to zero_stat, 
% it would return 40 because 40% of the elements are zero.

function P = zero_stat(M)
[m, n] = size(M);
a = sum(M);
b = sum(a);
P = (1 - b./m./n) * 100%%
fprintf ('The percentage of 0s in this matrix is %d %%', P)
