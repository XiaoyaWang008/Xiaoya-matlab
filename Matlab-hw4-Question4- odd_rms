% Write a function called odd_rmsthat returns orms, 
% which is the square root of the mean of the squares of the first nnpositive odd integers,
% where nnis a positive integer and is the only input argument. 
% For example, if nnis 3, your function needs to compute and 
% return the square root of the average of the numbers 1, 9, and 25. 
% You may use built-in functions including, for example, sumand sqrt, 
% except for the built-in function rms, which is not allowed.

function orms = odd_rms(nn)
f = (1: 2 : 2*nn);
a = f.^2;
[m n] = size(f);
b = sum(a)./n;
orms = sqrt(b);
end
