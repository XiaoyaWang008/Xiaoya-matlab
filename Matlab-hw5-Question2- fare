% Write a function called fare that computes the bus fare one must pay in a given city based on the distance travelled.
% Here is how the fare is calculated: the first mile is $2. 
% Each additional mile up to a total trip distance of 10 miles is 25 cents. 
% Each additional mile over 10 miles is 10 cents. 
% Miles are rounded to the nearest integer other than the first mile which must be paid in full once a journey begins.
% Children 18 or younger and seniors 60 or older get a 20% discount. 
% The inputs to the function are the distance of the journey and the age of the passenger in this order. 
% Return the fare in dollars,  e.g., 2.75 would be the result returned for a 4-mile trip with no discount.


function m = fare(distance, age)
if distance <= 1 && distance > 0
    n = 2;
elseif distance > 1 && distance < 10.5
    distance = round(distance);
    n = 2 + (distance - 1) * 0.25;
elseif distance > 10.5
    distance = round(distance);
    n = 2 + 9 * 0.25 + (distance - 10) * 0.1;
else distance <= 0;
    fprintf('Please input a positive distance integer.')
end
if age <= 18 || age >= 60
    m = n * 0.8;
else
    m = n;
end
