% Write a function called intquad that takes as its input arguments two scalar positive integers named n and m in that order. 
% The function returns Q, a 2n­by­2m matrix. Q consists of four n­by­m submatrices. 
% The elements of the submatrix in the top left corner are all 0s,
% the elements of the submatrix at the top right are 1s, 
% the elements in the bottom left are 2s,
% and the elements in the bottom right are 3s.

function Q = intquad (n, m);
A1 = zeros(n,m);
A2 = ones(n,m);
B1 = 2 * ones(n,m);
B2 = 3 * ones(n, m);
Q = [A1 A2; B1 B2]
