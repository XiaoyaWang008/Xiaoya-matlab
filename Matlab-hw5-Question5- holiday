% Write a function called holiday that takes two input arguments called month and day;
% both are scalar integers representing a month (1-12) and a day (1-31). 
% You do not need to check that the input is valid. The function returns a logical true
% if the specified date is a holiday; if not, it returns false. 
% For the purposes of this exercise, the following dates are considered holidays: 
% January 1st, July 4th, December 25th, and December 31st

function a = holiday(m, d)
if m == 1 && d ==1
    a = true;
elseif m == 7 && d ==4;
    a = true;
elseif m == 12 && d ==25;
    a = true;
elseif m == 12 && d ==31;
    a = true;
else
    a = false;
end
