% Write a function called sindeg that takes a matrix input called deg. 
% The function returns a matrix of the same size as deg with each of its elements containing 
% the sine of the corresponding element of deg.
% Note that the elements of deg are given in degrees and not radians. 
% As a second output, the function returns a scalar that contains the average value of the first output. 
% You are not allowed to use the sind and cosd built-in functions, 
% but the use of any other function is acceptable. 

function [Q, a] = sindeg(deg);
Q = sin(deg./180 * pi);
[m, n] = size(deg);
M = sum(Q);
a = sum(M)./ n./m;
end
