% Write a function called simple_stats that takes a matrix N as an input and returns the matrix S as the output.
% S has the same number of rows as N. Each element of the first column of S contains the mean of the corresponding row of N. 
% Similarly, the second column contains the median values; while the third column has the minimums. 
% Finally, each element of the fourth column of S is equal to the maximum value of given row of N.

function S = simple_stats(N)
S1 = mean(N,2);
S2 = median(N,2);
S3 = min(N, [], 2);
S4 = max(N, [], 2);
S = [S1 S2 S3 S4];
end
